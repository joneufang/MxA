# Mendix Platform SDK

The Mendix Platform SDK defines TypeScript classes that provide access to the Project API
(https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/projects-api).
The Projects API allows you to programmatically create a project in your company space and move working copies between the Team Server and the Model Server.
